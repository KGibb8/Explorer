# What is Explorer?

Explorer is the final project for the <a href="https://www.wegotcoders.com">WeGotCoders</a> Web Develper Fast Track 3 month training programme. It was completed in 9 days. 

Explorer is a hikers/walkers social network site, where friends can get together to organise to go walking in fantastic places around the world. Its also a place where you can meet new people with similar interests. Users can request to join Expeditions that other users create, and wait for approval from the expedition creator/moderator.

Here you can fill out the form providing the necessary details. Once the event has been created you can invite your friends along.
